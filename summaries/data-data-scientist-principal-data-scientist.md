Data role: Data scientist
- Data science is a broad and fast-moving field spanning maths, statistics, software engineering and communications. Data scientists will often work as part of a multidisciplinary team, using data and analytics to inform and achieve organisational goals.

In this role, you will:
- be inquisitive
- explore and visualise data
- make recommendations to address complex problems and to inform strategic and operational decision making
- use data ethically and appropriately
- be innovative and adaptable
- explore existing and new data using a range of statistical tools and techniques, such as machine learning and predictive analytics
- find patterns in data and transform them into organisational insight

Role level: Principal data scientist
- A principal data scientist is a leader of data science, quite often with responsibility for managing and developing teams.

At this role level, you will:
- have a broad knowledge of data science techniques, use cases and potential impact, as well as the tools and technologies
- have extensive experience in scoping, designing and delivering data science outputs and products
- work collaboratively with a range of experts in support of organisational objectives
- communicate effectively and challenge delivery plans and priorities
- appreciate and understand data ethics, data preparation and manipulation
- appreciate and understand delivery methods, and how to deliver supported solutions at scale

Skill: Applied maths, statistics and scientific practices
- identify opportunities to develop statistical insight, reports and models to support organisational objectives, while collaborating across the organisation effectively
- critique statistical analyses
- use a variety of data analytics techniques (such as data mining and prescriptive and predictive analytics) for complex data analysis through the whole data life cycle
- use model outputs to produce evidence and help design services and policies
- understand a broad range of statistical tools, particularly those deployed within the organisation, and can use these appropriately and help others to use them

Skill: Data engineering
- help to identify the data engineering requirements for any data science product, while working with data engineers and data scientists to design and deliver those products into the organisation effectively
- understand the need to cleanse and prepare data before including it in data science products and can put reusable processes and checks in place
- understand a broad range of architectures, including cloud and on-premise, and data manipulation and transformation tools deployed within the organisation, and can use these tools appropriately and help others use them

Skill: Data ethics and privacy
- work with stakeholders to identify and address ethical and privacy concerns
- demonstrate and communicate how data ethical issues fit into the wider organisational context
- research developments in data ethics and privacy to improve compliance and processes
- assess and constructively challenge proposed data ethics policies

Skill: Data science innovation
- be a leader in the data science space
- demonstrate in-depth knowledge of data science tools and techniques, which you can use to solve problems creatively and to create opportunities for your team
- act as a coach, inspiring curiosity and creativity in others
- demonstrate in-depth knowledge of your chosen profession and keep up to date with changes in the industry
- challenge the status quo and always look for ways to improve data science

Skill: Delivering business impact
- lead and support your organisation area by using data science to create change
- identify opportunities to develop data science products to support organisational objectives, while collaborating across the organisation to fulfil goals
- show an understanding of the role of user research, and can design and manage processes to gather and establish user needs
- communicate relevant and compelling stories effectively and present analysis and data visualisations clearly to get across complex messages
- work with colleagues to implement scalable data science products, and to understand maintenance requirements

Skill: Developing data science capability
- manage your CPD (continuous professional development) and can link your learning to objectives and organisational goals
- support data science capability building across the team and wider organisation
- confidently talk about the benefits of data science approaches to existing and potential customers
- demonstrate a good understanding of a range of data science techniques, such as machine learning and natural language processing, and you can use them to build data science solutions, including reports, models and dashboards

Skill: Programming and build (data science)
- write complex programs and scripts
- seek to make code open source where appropriate
- supervise junior analysts and set coding standards for your team
- understand software architecture and how to write efficient, optimised code
- perform user testing on products prior to launch

Skill: Understanding product delivery
- understand the differences between delivery methods, such as Agile and waterfall, and can choose the most appropriate method to deliver each product
- define the minimum viable product (MVP) and support decisions about priorities
- work with specialists in multidisciplinary teams to smoothly deliver data science products into the organisation
