Quality assurance testing (QAT) role: Quality assurance test analyst
- A quality assurance test analyst interprets testing needs, creating and executing appropriate tests to ensure quality and alignment with requirements. 

In this role, you will: 
- plan, design and execute tests
- apply testing techniques and standards to learn about systems and mitigate risk
- analyse artefacts and prototypes
- test outcomes and record defects
- seek to improve testing practices to enhance quality and reliability
- recommend testing approaches

Role level: Quality assurance test analyst
- A quality assurance test analyst designs and executes appropriate functional and non-functional tests. They apply multiple testing techniques to inform the approach to mitigate risk. 

At this role level, you will:
- apply the most appropriate test approaches and plans based on risk
- analyse artefacts, such as user stories, prototypes, processes and designs
- determine what to test following an agreed approach
- ensure test coverage aligns with business risk
- follow appropriate standards to mitigate risk early
- execute tests, develop reports, record outcomes and support the resolution of defects

Skill: Communicating between the technical and non-technical
- communicate effectively with technical and non-technical stakeholders
- support and host discussions within a multidisciplinary team, with potentially difficult dynamics
- be an advocate for the team externally
- manage differing stakeholder perspectives

Skill: Designing and executing tests
- set up suitable environments with some support
- select appropriate test types and techniques with some support
- design, build, maintain and execute tests that align to user needs and requirements
- conduct exploratory testing
- research and try new test types and techniques

Skill: Managing, reporting and resolving defects
- collaborate with others to create a defect management process to report, communicate and resolve defects, with support
- critically assess dependencies, defects and risks, with support
- contribute to mitigation and contingency plans
- clearly communicate risks and the impact of defects to stakeholders

Skill: Test analysis
- work with stakeholders to determine which functional and non-functional quality characteristics add value
- determine what to test following an agreed approach
- identify and advocate for test needs, such as data, access and environments, with support
- analyse information to identify risks

Skill: Test and quality planning
- create or adapt quality testing approaches based on risk, with some support
- follow a quality testing strategy and contribute to its development
- contribute to continuous improvement of quality testing approaches, plans and strategies

Skill: Test engineering
- explain why testing processes, environments and tools are important
- follow test engineering practices and standards, with support
- support the maintenance of automated tests and tools required for testing
