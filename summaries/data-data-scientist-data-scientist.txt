Data role: Data scientist
- Data science is a broad and fast-moving field spanning maths, statistics, software engineering and communications. Data scientists will often work as part of a multidisciplinary team, using data and analytics to inform and achieve organisational goals.

In this role, you will:
- be inquisitive
- explore and visualise data
- make recommendations to address complex problems and to inform strategic and operational decision making
- use data ethically and appropriately
- be innovative and adaptable
- explore existing and new data using a range of statistical tools and techniques, such as machine learning and predictive analytics
- find patterns in data and transform them into organisational insight

Role level: Data scientist
- A data scientist will work independently and have a good understanding of a range of topics, including data science techniques, delivery methods and stages (such as minimal viable products), tools and technologies.

At this role level, you will:
- develop complex solutions using a range of data science techniques, whilst understanding any ethical considerations
- understand the role and benefits of data science within the organisation
- support capability building within the organisation
- collaborate with others to develop data science solutions and outputs supporting the organisation
- prepare and manipulate data, and perform complex analytics
- present and communicate effectively

Skill: Applied maths, statistics and scientific practices
- apply designated quantitative techniques such as time series analysis, optimisation and simulation to create and embed appropriate models for analysis and prediction
- provide guidance on matching data sources with relevant applied mathematics and statistical techniques to meet analysis goals
- apply appropriate statistical techniques to available data to discover new relations and offer insight into research problems, helping to improve organisational processes and support decision making
- access and use the statistical tools available within the organisation

Skill: Data engineering
- work with data engineers and data scientists to design and provide products for the organisation

Skill: Data ethics and privacy
- work with stakeholders to identify and address ethical and privacy concerns
- demonstrate and communicate how data ethical issues fit into the wider organisational context
- research developments in data ethics and privacy to improve compliance and processes
- assess and constructively challenge proposed data ethics policies

Skill: Data science innovation
- demonstrate practical knowledge of data science tools and techniques
- develop data science solutions that maximise insight
- identify opportunities for how data science can improve data practices

Skill: Delivering business impact
- show an understanding of the organisation and the benefits of data science
- collaborate to help identify user needs and develop and deliver data science products
- communicate effectively and present analysis and visualisations tailored to your audience

Skill: Developing data science capability
- manage your CPD (continuous professional development) and can link your learning to objectives and organisational goals
- support data science capability building across the team and wider organisation
- confidently talk about the benefits of data science approaches to existing and potential customers
- demonstrate a good understanding of a range of data science techniques, such as machine learning and natural language processing, and you can use them to build data science solutions, including reports, models and dashboards

Skill: Programming and build (data science)
- write moderate to complex programs and scripts
- show a good understanding of testing methodologies and how to deploy code

Skill: Understanding product delivery
- understand the differences between delivery methods, such as Agile and waterfall, and can choose the most appropriate method to deliver each product
- define the minimum viable product (MVP) and support decisions about priorities
- work with specialists in multidisciplinary teams to smoothly deliver data science products into the organisation
