- keep up to date with new developments in data science and can match those to opportunities in your organisation
- talk confidently about the benefits of data science approaches to existing and potential customers
- demonstrate an in-depth understanding of a wide range of data science techniques, such as machine learning and natural language processing, and detailed knowledge of at least one specialism
- use these techniques to build data science solutions, including reports, models and dashboards

Skill: Programming and build (data science)
- write complex programs and scripts
- seek to make code open source where appropriate
- supervise junior analysts and set coding standards for your team
- understand software architecture and how to write efficient, optimised code
- perform user testing on products prior to launch

Skill: Understanding product delivery
- understand the differences between delivery methods, such as Agile and waterfall, and can set out how your team should use and adapt these methods
- lead a team through the different phases of the product delivery life cycle
- collaborate with the product manager to influence the direction of work
- identify and involve relevant teams to smoothly deliver data science products into the organisation, ensuring these products inform decision making
- ensure products are monitored, maintained and continually improved, engaging and working with others where necessary
- have oversight of any data science features implemented within products or services
