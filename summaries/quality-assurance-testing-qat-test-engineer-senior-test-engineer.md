Quality assurance testing (QAT) role: Test engineer
- A test engineer undertakes test planning activity including discovery capture, test definition and the estimation of test effort, as part of a broader risk-based approach.

Role level: Senior test engineer
- A senior test engineer has similar responsibilities to a test engineer but at a more complex level and on a greater scale.

At this role level, you will:
- identify and raise awareness of risks arising from the automation test results
- identify new and implement existing test frameworks to improve confidence in testing
- be proficient in a range of coding languages (you may be an expert in only one)
- mentor and advise other team members in testing practices

Skill: Communicating between the technical and non-technical
- listen to and interpret the needs of technical and non-technical stakeholders, and manage their expectations
- manage active and reactive communication
- support or host difficult discussions within the team or with diverse senior stakeholders

Skill: Designing and executing tests
- set up suitable environments
- influence and guide the use of appropriate test types and techniques to mitigate risk early
- lead others in designing, building, maintaining and executing tests that align to user needs and requirements
- contribute to developing and implementing standards for designing and executing tests
- improve test types and techniques through a structured process.

Skill: Managing, reporting and resolving defects
- contribute to developing standards for defect management processes
- manage and escalate dependencies, defects and risks across teams
- contribute to mitigation and contingency plans across teams
- use defect patterns and trends to make recommendations on testing and quality approaches, with support
- manage stakeholder expectations and communications during defect resolution

Skill: Test analysis
- lead work with stakeholders across teams to determine which functional and non-functional quality characteristics add value
- determine if an approach needs to change based on effort and risk
- ensure test needs are implemented early
- use multiple techniques to analyse complex information to identify risks
- coach others in test analysis

Skill: Test and quality planning
- work with teams to develop and implement appropriate quality testing approaches, plans and strategies
- contribute to organisational quality testing strategies
- implement ways to capture data to drive continuous improvement of quality testing approaches, plans and strategies
- advocate for full team ownership of quality testing activities, encouraging early engagement

Skill: Test engineering
- develop, standardise and extend reusable frameworks and tools to support a range of testing activities
- guide and coach others in creating and maintaining comprehensive and reliable tests that meet standards
- research and prepare for future testing needs, including tools, methodologies and techniques
- maintain and adapt CI/CD pipelines
