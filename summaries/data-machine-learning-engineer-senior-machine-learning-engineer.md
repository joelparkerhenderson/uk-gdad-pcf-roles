Data role: Machine learning engineer
- A machine learning engineer develops, assures and maintains machine learning models so they can be used in products and services.

In this role, you will:
- be responsible for the software development and technical infrastructure needed to design, train, deploy and scale machine learning models
- provide and maintain effective, secure and sustainable machine learning models for use in products and services
- support all stages of the machine learning life cycle
- help product teams evaluate and choose appropriate machine learning solutions

Role level: Senior machine learning engineer
- A senior machine learning engineer develops machine learning models so they can be used in products and services.

At this role level, you will:
- decide what model is most suitable for use in products and services
- customise, optimise, re-train and maintain existing models
- deploy models into production, testing and assuring them to ensure they meet performance requirements
- work with others to integrate models with existing systems
- check that models used in live products and services stay safe, secure and continue to work effectively

Skill: Applied maths, statistics and scientific practices
- apply designated quantitative techniques such as time series analysis, optimisation and simulation to create and embed appropriate models for analysis and prediction
- provide guidance on matching data sources with relevant applied mathematics and statistical techniques to meet analysis goals
- apply appropriate statistical techniques to available data to discover new relations and offer insight into research problems, helping to improve organisational processes and support decision making
- access and use the statistical tools available within the organisation

Skill: Communicating between the technical and non-technical
- listen to and interpret the needs of technical and non-technical stakeholders, and manage their expectations
- manage active and reactive communication
- support or host difficult discussions within the team or with diverse senior stakeholders

Skill: Data ethics and privacy
- work with stakeholders to identify and address ethical and privacy concerns
- demonstrate and communicate how data ethical issues fit into the wider organisational context
- research developments in data ethics and privacy to improve compliance and processes
- assess and constructively challenge proposed data ethics policies

Skill: Data science innovation
- demonstrate practical knowledge of data science tools and techniques
- develop data science solutions that maximise insight
- identify opportunities for how data science can improve data practices

Skill: Programming and build (software engineering)
- collaborate with others when necessary to review specifications
- use the agreed specifications to design, code, test and document programs or scripts of medium-to-high complexity, using the right standards and tools

Skill: Systems integration
- define the integration build
- co-ordinate build activities across systems
- understand how to undertake and support integration testing activities
