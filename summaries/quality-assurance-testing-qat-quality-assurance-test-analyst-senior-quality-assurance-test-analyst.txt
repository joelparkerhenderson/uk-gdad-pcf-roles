- seek to improve testing practices to enhance quality and reliability
- recommend testing approaches

Role level: Senior quality assurance test analyst
- A senior quality assurance test analyst influences and guides others in test analysis, coordinating quality assurance activities in a defined area. They assess the business impact of testing outcomes and use insights to improve quality assurance processes.

At this role level, you will: 
- use the most appropriate tools and techniques to analyse artefacts such as products, services, processes and change, to identify risks early
- work with others to support teams in developing approaches, plans and strategy, considering environments, data, tools and resources
- communicate chosen approaches, tools, techniques and outcomes to stakeholders
- guide others in quality assurance tools and techniques
- contribute to, and enable others to follow, quality assurance and testing standards

Skill: Communicating between the technical and non-technical
